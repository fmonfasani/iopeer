# IOpeer â€“ Code of Conduct

The primary source of the Code of Conduct is here.

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of the IOpeer community is to support you and your business in the development, use and implementation of IOpeer. We aim to be inclusive and provide value to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.  

As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.  

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, whether in-person or online, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.  

Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in all IOpeer activities, including but not limited to:

- Using IOpeer community resources.
- Working with other IOpeer contributors and community participants, whether virtually or co-located.
- Representing IOpeer at public events.
- Representing IOpeer in social media (official accounts, personal accounts, Facebook pages and groups).
- Participating in IOpeer sprints, training, and hackathons.
- Participating in IOpeer-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person meetings, and correspondence.  

We invite all those who participate in IOpeer activities online to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone, everywhere.

## 2. Open Source & Culture Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source and culture citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.  

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.  

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.
