# Security

Contact: security@iopeer.com

This repository is part of the private IOPeer SaaS product. Security is a top priority. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the instructions below.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- E-mail: `security@iopeer.com`.
- Provide: affected component/path, environment or URL, steps to reproduce, and a minimal proof-of-concept (if possible).
- If the issue is critical (active exploitation, data exfiltration, critical RCE), mark the subject `CRITICAL` and call the on-call security engineer.

## Do NOT
- Do not run destructive actions on production systems.
- Do not publicly disclose the issue before it is fixed and coordinated with us.
- Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability beyond what is needed to demonstrate it.

## Guidelines
- Avoid automated scanning on production systems without prior approval.
- Provide clear reproduction steps (IP, timestamps, request payloads, logs).
- Use responsible disclosure â€” we will work with you to remediate quickly.

## What we promise
- Acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- Coordinate remediation and give you an estimated timeline.
- If you follow responsible disclosure guidance, we will not pursue legal action for the report.
- We will credit researchers for reported issues, unless they request anonymity.
