## Before you contribute
- This codebase is private. Do not fork, mirror, or publish it externally.
- Make sure you have approvals required by your manager or the repo owner.
- Use the internal development environment (`.env.example`) and follow infra instructions in the README.

## Workflow
1. Create a branch from `main` named: `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
2. Keep changes focused and well-scoped.
3. Add tests for new behavior; update existing tests if necessary.
4. Run linters and unit tests locally:
   ```bash
   pnpm -r lint
   pnpm -r test
